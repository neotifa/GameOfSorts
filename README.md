===========

Since my team apparently disbanded, I'm all alone again, so I'm just gonna start coding and see where it goes. :/
Well, 1 guy came back and my class partner came to help. Thanks Matt Young and Bryan Arnold! :D

I've never actually done an RPG before as I've only ever done "shooters" and "arcade" type games, so I'm going to try that. I'm first going to get some GUI going, maybe a tile scrolling engine with crap graphics, and move forward from there.

TODOs (and done dids):
  * Make tile scrolling engine (only shows 1 tile wtf?)
  * Animate player image (sorta done)
  * Create AI for enemies
  * Create collision detection engine
  * Create towns and events
  * Create NPCs
  * Create NPC images
  * Create AI for NPCs
  * Storyline
  * Events?
  * Better graphics?

DUNDIDs:
  * Make rudamentary GUI (done)
  * Make tile images (done)
  * Create player (done)
  * Make player image (done)
  * Add enemies (done)
  * Make images for enemies (done)

Can I not single space or what? This formatting look like dookie!
